# Travel Journal React App

This is a Travel Journal React App that allows users to create and share their travel experiences with others. Users can create a profile, add travel destinations, upload photos, and write about their experiences. The app is built with React and uses Firebase for authentication and storage.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
npm install` 

You will also need to create a Firebase project and enable authentication and storage. Once you have done so, you can add your Firebase config information to the `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

makefileCopy code

`REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your-firebase-api-key>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your-firebase-auth-domain>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-firebase-project-id>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your-firebase-storage-bucket>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<your-firebase-messaging-sender-id>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your-firebase-app-id>` 

Finally, you can start the development server using the following command:

sqlCopy code

`npm start` 

This will start a local development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), where you can view the app in your browser.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, simply run the following command:

arduinoCopy code

`npm run build` 

This will generate a production-ready version of the app in the `build` directory.
